# About

MEng in electronics who'd rather work with writing software than to work with the stuff that people think electronic engineers do.
It's not necessarily that I'm bad at the electronic-y stuff, it's just that I enjoy writing software more, and I'm kinda good at it, I guess.

# What I do

Some projects here and there, mostly when I canáº— find an implementation of stuff the way I want it.
Currently working (or going to work, starting September 21') at arm as a "productivity engineer", which means I'm paid to write code that makes the company more productive, I think.

# What I can do

I wrote my master thesis on detection and classification on bird vocalizations, and you can find some pretty decent, reusable code for sound event detection in the SSED-repo.
I have done some of deep learning stuff, but I probably couldn't work as a data scientist, because I think Jupyter Notebooks are fugly and encourage people to write shit code.
Nothing wrong with that if you don't care about code quality though, it's just that I *somewhat* do.

I'm good at Python, C, and Bash.
I'm decent at Matlab, C++, Makefiles.
I'm crap at golang, vhdl, systemverilog.

# Places I've been

Worked as an embedded programmer for a scientific project at NTNU, called "building brains", pretty dope stuff, was fun.

Worked as a programmer for safebikely (now they're called bikely).

Spent summer 2019 as an intern at Galleon Embedded Electronics writing code for embedded recording systems.

Summer 2020 I interned at arm, which is how I got the gig I'm doing now.

Had a very brief period as a test intern at Microchip in the fall of 2020 where I wrote some python stuff.

Don't know how forward I can be about the stuff I've done, so I'm keeping it a bit vague.
